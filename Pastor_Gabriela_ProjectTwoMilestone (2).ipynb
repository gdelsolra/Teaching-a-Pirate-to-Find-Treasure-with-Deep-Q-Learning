    "## Read and Review Your Starter Code\n",
    "The theme of this project is a popular treasure hunt game in which the player needs to find the treasure before the pirate does. While you will not be developing the entire game, you will write the part of the game that represents the intelligent agent, which is a pirate in this case. The pirate will try to find the optimal path to the treasure using deep Q-learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with two Python classes and this notebook to help you with this assignment. The first class, TreasureMaze.py, represents the environment, which includes a maze object defined as a matrix. The second class, GameExperience.py, stores the episodes â€“ that is, all the states that come in between the initial state and the terminal state. This is later used by the agent for learning by experience, called \"exploration\". This notebook shows how to play a game. Your task is to complete the deep Q-learning implementation for which a skeleton implementation has been provided. The code blocks you will need to complete has #TODO as a header.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, read and review the next few code and instruction blocks to understand the code that you have been given."

    "I built the pirate agent using deep Q-learning with experience replay. During training the agent started from random free cells so it could learn a general way to navigate the maze, but for evaluation I tested it from the required top-left start to make sure it met the assignment condition. Action selection was handled with an E-greedy policy: it explored at first and gradually relied more on what it had learned as the win rate improved. Once the agent was doing well (above a threshold), exploration was reduced faster so it could exploit the learned policy. Training kept track of recent performance, and stopped early when the agent consistently hit a 100% win rate and passed the completion check.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happened:**  \n",
    "- The model reached a stable 100% win rate at epoch 104 out of the 1000 allowed.  \n",
    "- When tested from the starting position (0,0), the pirate successfully found the treasure confirmed by the completion check and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques I used:**  \n",
    "- Experience replay to reuse past transitions and break correlation between consecutive steps.  \n",
    "- Bellman-style updates via the neural network to estimate Q-values.  \n",
    "- E-greedy exploration with decay to balance trying new moves and exploiting good ones.  \n",
    "- Early stopping once the agent proved it could win consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts / next steps:**  \n",
    "I could improve stability further by adding a separate target network or trying different exploration decay schedules to help it learn faster early on.\n"
